<p>Arianna Huffington&#8217;s personal wake-up call came in the form of a broken cheekbone and a nasty gash over her eye &#8212; the result of a fall brought on by exhaustion and lack of sleep. As the cofounder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group &#8212; one of the fastest growing media companies in the world &#8212; celebrated as one of the world&#8217;s most influential women, and gracing the covers of magazines, she was, by any traditional measure, extraordinarily successful. Yet as she found herself going from brain MRI to CAT scan to echocardiogram, to find out if there was any underlying medical problem beyond exhaustion, she wondered is this really what success feels like?</p>
<p>As more and more people are coming to realize, there is far more to living a truly successful life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office. Our relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of success &#8212; money and power &#8212; has led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses, and an erosion in the quality of our relationships, family life, and, ironically, our careers. In being connected to the world 24/7, we&#8217;re losing our connection to what truly matters. Our current definition of success is, as Thrive shows, literally killing us. We need a new way forward.</p>
<p>In a commencement address Arianna gave at Smith College in the spring of 2013, she likened our drive for money and power to two legs of a three-legged stool. They may hold us up temporarily, but sooner or later we&#8217;re going to topple over. We need a third leg &#8212; a third metric for defining success &#8212; to truly thrive. That third metric, she writes in Thrive, includes our well-being, our ability to draw on our intuition and inner wisdom, our sense of wonder, and our capacity for compassion and giving. As Arianna points out, our eulogies celebrate our lives very differently from the way society defines success. They don&#8217;t commemorate our long hours in the office, our promotions, or our sterling PowerPoint presentations as we relentlessly raced to climb up the career ladder. They are not about our resumes &#8212; they are about cherished memories, shared adventures, small kindnesses and acts of generosity, lifelong passions, and the things that made us laugh.</p>
<p>In this deeply personal book, Arianna talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing the demands of a career and raising two daughters &#8212; of juggling business deadlines and family crises, a harried dance that led to her collapse and to her &#8220;aha moment.&#8221; Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the fields of psychology, sports, sleep, and physiology that show the profound and transformative effects of meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving, Arianna shows us the way to a revolution in our culture, our thinking, our workplace, and our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Formatted">This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies.&#8221; So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies &#8212; they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 &#8212; and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day &#8212; as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: &#8220;What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?&#8221; What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter &amp; Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world&#8217;s best commercial aircraft company &#8212; what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.</span></p>

Mark Twain once observed, "A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on." His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas--entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists--struggle to make them "stick."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Formatted"><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER &#8211; The instant classic about why some ideas thrive, why others die, and how to improve your idea&#8217;s chances&#8211;essential reading in the &#8220;fake news&#8221; era.</b></span></p>
<p>Mark Twain once observed, &#8220;A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.&#8221; His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas&#8211;entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists&#8211;struggle to make them &#8220;stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>In <i>Made to Stick</i>, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds&#8211;from the infamous &#8220;kidney theft ring&#8221; hoax to a coach&#8217;s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony&#8211;draw their power from the same six traits.</p>
<p><i>Made to Stick</i> will transform the way you communicate. It&#8217;s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.</p>
<p>Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, <i>Made to Stick</i> shows us the vital principles of winning ideas&#8211;and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.</p>
