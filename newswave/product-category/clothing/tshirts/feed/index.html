										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Formatted">A novel on the anxiety and disconnection of post-9/11 America, on the insidiousness of racism, the blind-sidedness of war, and the recklessness thrust on others in the name of love.</p>
<p>As the United States begins gearing up for war in the Middle East, twenty-year-old Tassie Keltjin, the Midwestern daughter of a gentleman hill farmer—his “Keltjin potatoes” are justifiably famous—has come to a university town as a college student, her brain on fire with Chaucer, Sylvia Plath, Simone de Beauvoir.</p>
<p>Between semesters, she takes a job as a part-time nanny.</p>
<p>The family she works for seems both mysterious and glamorous to her, and although Tassie had once found children boring, she comes to care for, and to protect, their newly adopted little girl as her own.</p>
<p>As the year unfolds and she is drawn deeper into each of these lives, her own life back home becomes ever more alien to her: her parents are frailer; her brother, aimless and lost in high school, contemplates joining the military. Tassie finds herself becoming more and more the stranger she felt herself to be, and as life and love unravel dramatically, even shockingly, she is forever changed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Formatted"><b>A superb novel about two sisters, the true meaning of success, and the qualities in life that matter most.</b></p>
<p>From Anna Quindlen, acclaimed author of Blessings, Black and Blue, and One True Thing, a superb novel about two sisters, the true meaning of success, and the qualities in life that matter most.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an otherwise ordinary Monday when Meghan Fitzmaurice&#8217;s perfect life hits a wall. A household name as the host of Rise and Shine, the country&#8217;s highest-rated morning talk show, Meghan cuts to a commercial break–but not before she mutters two forbidden words into her open mike.</p>
<p>In an instant, it&#8217;s the end of an era, not only for Meghan, who is unaccustomed to dealing with adversity, but also for her younger sister, Bridget, a social worker in the Bronx who has always lived in Meghan&#8217;s long shadow. The effect of Meghan&#8217;s on-air truth telling reverberates through both their lives, affecting Meghan&#8217;s son, husband, friends, and fans, as well as Bridget&#8217;s perception of her sister, their complex childhood, and herself. What follows is a story about how, in very different ways, the Fitzmaurice women adapt, survive, and manage to bring the whole teeming world of New York to heel by dint of their smart mouths, quick wits, and the powerful connection between them that even the worst tragedy cannot shatter.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Formatted"><b>A powerful, revealing story of hope, love, justice, and the power of reading by a man who spent thirty years on death row for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit.</b></p>
<p>In 1985, Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder in Alabama. Stunned, confused, and only twenty-nine years old, Hinton knew that it was a case of mistaken identity and believed that the truth would prove his innocence and ultimately set him free.</p>
<p>But with no money and a different system of justice for a poor black man in the South, Hinton was sentenced to death by electrocution. He spent his first three years on Death Row at Holman State Prison in agonizing silence—full of despair and anger toward all those who had sent an innocent man to his death. But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. For the next twenty-seven years he was a beacon—transforming not only his own spirit, but those of his fellow inmates, fifty-four of whom were executed mere feet from his cell. With the help of civil rights attorney and bestselling author of <i>Just Mercy</i>, Bryan Stevenson, Hinton won his release in 2015.</p>
<p>With a foreword by Stevenson, <i>The Sun Does Shine</i> is an extraordinary testament to the power of hope sustained through the darkest times. Destined to be a classic memoir of wrongful imprisonment and freedom won, Hinton’s memoir tells his dramatic thirty-year journey and shows how you can take away a man’s freedom, but you can’t take away his imagination, humor, or joy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Formatted">Underneath the steps leading down to Eric&#8217;s basement is a hidden storage space. It&#8217;s dusty and old- nothing special at all. But when Eric, Julie, and Neal all huddle inside the gray room together, something unbelievable happens. A glittering light and then a rainbow-colored staircase appear. And as the kids take their very first step down into the mysterious land of Droon, they know that only magic and adventure await them!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="Formatted">A<b> </b>legacy that has touched audiences all over the world began in Dallas, Texas, in 1972 when Zig Ziglar recorded perhaps the definitive work of his career. <i>Biscuits Fleas and Pump Handles </i>is the compilation of observations, thoughts and research Zig had spent years preparing to present as the foundation of a philosophy born of hope and nurtured with integrity. In this 60 minute recording, Zig lays out a plan for living a balanced and fulfilling life, teaching us that we can have everything in life we want if we will just help enough other people get what they want. The applications outlined in this message have changed lives, built careers, and propelled individuals and institutions to unexpected heights. Used as the cornerstone for all training provided by Ziglar, this program is packed with answers to tough questions in turbulent times.</span></p>
